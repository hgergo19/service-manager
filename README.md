# service-manager

A web application for managing jobs and clients.

This is a hobby project to keep me practicing my coding skills.

The Plan

To make a Sprig Boot application which handles jobs and service reports for an on-field service company. 
Manages an MySQL 8 database and uses Thymeleaf as template engine. The frontend content is generated by the backend.

In the future I plan to create a RESTful version with a frontent framework connected to the SprinBoot backend.
