# On-field service manager

A web application for managing jobs and clients.
This is a hobby project to keep me practicing my coding skills.

## The Plan

To make a Sprig Boot application which:
- handles customer 
- their machines 
- employees as users 
- jobs and 
- service reports 
for an on-field service company. 

1. Manages an MySQL 8 database and 
2. uses Thymeleaf as template engine. 

The frontend content is generated by the backend.

In the future I plan to create a RESTful version with a frontent framework connected to the SprinBoot backend.
