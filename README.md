# On-field service manager

A web application for managing jobs and clients.
This is a project to practice and display my skills in JAVA 8 and SpringBoot.

## Vision

To create a cloud based application for an on-field service agency. 
With the application the technicians can manage their everyday work, and connect easily with the back-office, making their work easier.

The Sprig Boot application can:
- handle customer 
- their machines 
- employees as users 
- jobs and 
- service reports 

1. Manages an MySQL 8 database and 
2. uses Thymeleaf as template engine. 

The frontend content is generated by the backend.

In the future I plan to create a RESTful version with a frontent framework connected to the SprinBoot backend.
